Hey, brother
It's been too long
So I put out my hand
I was wrong
But tell me
Where to from here
You won't say a word
And you won't come near

We've got history
You deny it
And this silence that you keep
Speaks loud and clear

So we've found someone to blame
And nothing is going to change

Hey, friend
Don't turn your back

Hey, brother
We're wasting time
I hurt you, now you hurt me
It's a life of crime
The problem I think is pride
No one's willing to lose, we defend
Or run and hide

It's our destiny
To take the open road
We don't have to walk
That road alone

It's the things we have at stake
Here behind the noise we make

Oh, friend
Don't turn your back
While I watched you slip away
I know love lies sleeping

My friend
Forgive the past
Let the good things last
And brother together we can move on

Hey, brother
So far away
If our paths should cross
What would you say

I tell you
Say it now
Or we'll lose the grace,
That time has allowed
